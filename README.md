### The Machine Learning Version of "Hello, World"

ML and AI are terms that are frequently thrown around in the tech world. These concepts have started to find their way into everyday workflows, whether through code modernization, innovative problem-solving approaches, or, to be real, most of us just using GenAI tools like chatbots.

However, I believe that they still feel more like concepts than practical tools for most developersâ€”especially those not focused on data science. To address this, I am embarking on a journey to develop models that will help demystify AI and make it more accessible.
